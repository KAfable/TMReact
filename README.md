## Contributor FAQ

### What if I want to contribute?

First we would ask the contributor familiarize themselves with the base game. The original board game is incredibly stateful, complex, and deserves all of the accolades it was awarded. You can purchase the [original board game here](https://www.fryxgames.se/produkt/terraforming-mars/). Other methods of play include the Tabletop Simulator developed by the MMGA team.

If you are familiar with the game and it's expansions, then please check out the roadmap section above for progress in our current features, and feel free to get in contact with us on how to best align your skillset with the current requirements.

### Are there any minimum requirements to contribute?

Due to the personal nature of this project, I don't have mandated standards nor experience requirements for contributors, after all I started this to learn more about OOP principles, Typescript, and a love of the game in my free time. I would consider it a victory if another person were to use this project as a learning opportunity. In addition, another helpful, more complete, and active repository is the [terraforming mars web app](https://github.com/bafolts/terraforming-mars) by the TMWeb team.
